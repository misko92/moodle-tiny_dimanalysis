/**
 * Tiny dimanalysis plugin.
 *
 * A lightweight authoring aid that visually highlights recognised
 * dimensional-analysis expressions while editing. It has no toolbar
 * button or menu item of its own, so it does not implement
 * plugin_with_buttons or plugin_with_menuitems - it only needs to be
 * loaded so its AMD module can register its (purely visual,
 * non-mutating) editor event handlers.
